# DingoOS Project Board

Public, sanitized engineering control centre for DingoOS Pty Ltd.

**Board:** https://phillipbarnard07-cell.github.io/DingoOS-Project-Board/

This repository is deliberately separate from the private canonical DingoOS repository. It contains project-board information only: progress metrics, architecture maps, workstream status, milestones and public-safe links.

It does not mirror proprietary source code, private IP, credentials, protected governance implementation, security roots or internal infrastructure.

Implemented means executable code exists. Tested means automated tests cover behavior. Integrated means connected to the canonical runtime. Verified means evidence demonstrates the contract. Design documentation is never counted as implementation.

## Current engineering checkpoint — 2026-10-08

**Canonical integration:** DingoOS PR #69, branch `integration/all-github-repositories`.

**Current block:** durable execution lifecycle hardening (pre-execution preparation → terminal result → stage commit), followed by executable repository-wide verification.

**Implemented in the private canonical repository:**
- typed, schema-shaped `ExecutionObject` contract with deterministic digest and fail-closed status rules;
- scheduler `ComputeDecision` now preserves selected `resource_id`;
- DDEP can run in strict binding mode and durably record one `EXECUTION_OBJECT` per committed stage;
- execution authorization is explicitly separated from scheduler/resource eligibility; strict DDEP execution fails closed without explicit authorization;
- the authorization gate reuses canonical `Authorization` primitives, requires matching resource and `AUTHORIZE` scope, and records the authorization reference/result;
- restore validates persisted execution authorization without silently reauthorizing replay; resume re-enters the pre-execution authorization gate;
- malformed execution records, non-finite latency, scheduler/execution authorization confusion, and related fail-closed boundaries have regression coverage;
- the local foundation runner now excludes runtime `artifacts/` from source inventory and fails closed on repository symlinks, with regression tests for both boundaries;
- hosted workflows on the integration branch remain manual-only to preserve the project cost boundary;
- durable execution lifecycle events now persist an authorized `PREPARED` event before consequential execution and a terminal `SUCCEEDED`/`FAILED` event before the DDEP stage commit;
- orphaned or terminal-without-commit execution lifecycles fail closed and block re-execution pending recovery/reconciliation;
- the prior post-execution `EXECUTION_OBJECT` persistence model remains available as an explicit compatibility mode (`durable_execution_lifecycle=False`) rather than being discarded.

**Verification state:** **HOLD / NOT VERIFIED**. The current execution environment can inspect and modify the GitHub branch but cannot execute the repository-local runner because no usable checkout is available and network resolution for GitHub is unavailable. Existing hosted Foundation Gates evidence remains non-actionable at executable-step level (`steps: null`, `logs_url: null`); no source-code failure is inferred.

**Cost boundary:** no paid GitHub service is required or introduced.

**Current DingoOS head:** `012d86d198b4574049f1c33356467b8c3c0e6624`.

**Branch relation:** integration branch is currently 140 commits ahead / 3 behind `main` and remains diverged; PR #69 is open and non-mergeable.

The board intentionally does not claim scientific validation, production certification, consequential deployment, or overall completion percentage.
